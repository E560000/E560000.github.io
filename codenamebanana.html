        Hello! You're here because i wanted to conduct a survey.<n>
        I am a teenager that's interested in the reason on why people bought a yellow car. So hopefully you own one!<n>
        Hopefully you got here through the flyer that you saw on your car, if not then please don't fill out the survey.<n>
        Below you'll find a few boxes (or other options if i change it) to fill out, please be honest with your answers!<n>
        This should take around 2 minutes of your time. (subject to how much detail is requested)<n>
        </p>
