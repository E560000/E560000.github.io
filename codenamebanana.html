        Hello! You're here because i wanted to conduct a survey.
        I am a teenager that's interested in the reason on why people bought a yellow car. So hopefully you own one!
        Hopefully you got here through the flyer that you saw on your car, if not then please don't fill out the survey.
        Below you'll find a few boxes (or other options if i change it) to fill out, please be honest with your answers!
        This should take around 2 minutes of your time. (subject to how much detail is requested)
        </p>
